CityGen is a Matlab-based code to produce randomized city models.
CityGen outputs a matrix which contains the coordinates for the position of buildings in the city domain. The matrix can be input into QES (QUIC-EnvSim) and be used to simulate city-scale urban environmental simulations.

CityGen requires 3 main inputs:
- plan area fraction (PAF), the ration between building rooftop area and city domain
- mu, sigma, the meand and standard deviation of building heights in the considered city domain
